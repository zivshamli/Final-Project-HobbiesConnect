## Sign Up Screen

The sign-up screen in HobbiesConnect allows users to register with essential information and upload a profile picture. Upon launching this screen, users are prompted to:

- **Grant Permissions**: Users must grant permission to upload a profile picture from their gallery. If granted, they can select an image, which is stored in Firebase Storage.
- **Profile Picture Display**: After selecting the profile picture, the app uses the **Glide** library to load and display the image efficiently in the UI.
- **Input Fields**: Users enter their email, password, and confirm their password.
- **Select Birth Year**: Users specify their year of birth.
- **Choose Hobbies**: Users select up to 5 hobbies. If more than five are selected, a toast message will appear, reminding them to choose only up to 5 hobbies. A summary list of chosen hobbies is also displayed.

Once all information is filled out, users tap the **Save** button to complete registration. A loading lottie appears while the app saves the data and then transitions to the main navigation screen.

### Search Filters
